# AutoRDPWrapper
A tool I made that automates setting up [RDPWrapper](https://github.com/stascorp/rdpwrap) (Bee Swarm Simulator)
## ⚠️ Warning
While nothing *should* happen, use this tool at your own risk. There is always a chance it could mess up your Windows installation. If you’re unsure, do **not** use this. 

## What is this?
After a lot of people started asking me for help with setting up RDPWrapper For Macroing in Bee Swarm Simulator, I decided to make a tool that automates most of the process for you.

## What is RDPWrapper?
RDP Wrapper is a tool that allows you to use macros (like [Natro Macro](https://github.com/NatroTeam/NatroMacro)) while your PC is being used. (Also works great for running 2 Roblox instances at once) 
While I am pretty sure that RDPWrapper was not intended for this, a lot of people (In the Roblox Community) primarily use it for Bee Swarm Simulator.
